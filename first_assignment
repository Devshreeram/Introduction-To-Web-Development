 #Explain the main compinents of clint-server architecture and their functions. 
ans:-Client-Server Architecture:
The client-server architecture is a distributed application structure that separates the application logic into two main components: the client and the server.
Main Components:
Client: The client is the user-facing side of the application, responsible for interacting with the user and sending requests to the server. In the context of web development, the client is typically a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) that runs on a user's device.
Functions:
Receives user input (e.g., clicks, form submissions)
Sends HTTP requests to the server
Renders the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript responses
Displays the resulting web page to the user
HTML's Role: In the client-side, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to define the structure and content of web pages. The client's web browser receives HTML documents from the server and renders them into a visual representation.
Server: The server is the backend component that processes requests from clients, retrieves or generates the necessary data, and sends responses back to the client.
Functions:
Receives HTTP requests from clients
Processes requests (e.g., database queries, authentication)
Generates responses (e.g., HTML, JSON, images)
Sends responses back to the client
HTML's Role: On the server-side, HTML is generated dynamically by the server-side programming language (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) and sent as a response to the client's request. The server may also store static HTML files that can be served directly to clients.
